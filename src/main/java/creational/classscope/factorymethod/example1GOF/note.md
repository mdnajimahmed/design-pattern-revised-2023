- Factory methods lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- Let the subclasses decide which classes to instantiate.
- AKA virtual constructor.
- Applicability: Use factory method when 
  - A class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
  - A class wants it's subclassses to specify the objects it creates
- Benefit:
  - Provides hooks for subclasses
  - Connects parallel class hierarchies.
